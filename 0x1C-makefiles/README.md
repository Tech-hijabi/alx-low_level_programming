Make reads its instruction from Makefile (called the descriptor file) by
default.
• Makefile sets a set of rules to determine which parts of a program
need to be recompile, and issues command to recompile them.
• Makefile is a way of automating software building procedure and other
complex tasks with dependencies.
• Makefile contains: dependency rules, macros and suffix(or implicit)
rules.
So, in this project I will be writing my own makefiles using the the *.c files provided for me
